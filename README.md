# JSON Translation Helper for Laravel
JSON Translation Helper scans your project for `__()`, `lang()` translation helper methods and `@lang` directives, then it creates keys in your JSON translation files. 

And yes, it avoids duplicates â€“ helper creates only non-existing keys. Ready for your translation.
